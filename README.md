# Bike Sharing Data
# Udacity-Project-Bike-Share-Analysis
## Overview
In this project,we will make use of **Python** to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. In this project we have perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics
### Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. The data is provided by Motivate, which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration (in seconds)
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The **Chicago** and **New York City** files also contain the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

## Questions explored
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:
* What is the most popular month for start time?
* What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
* What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
* What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
* What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
* What is the most popular trip?
* What are the counts of each user type?
* What are the counts of gender?
* What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and * most popular birth years?
